    <p align="justify">I wanted to add on to my original &quot;STUDIES&quot; website. I intended the new work to be <em>a part of</em> the STUDIES site yet be a distinct branching off from the self-reflexivity and immediate reporting of the STUDIES work itself. I wanted to maintain a continuity with my project and needed a couple of buckets full of new content so that I could give the viewer something new to engage in <em>and</em> demonstrate that this takes coding! For me, this website coding is like building - digital building. So what led me here? The easy answer could be &quot;all of my previous experience&quot;.</p>
    <p align="justify">Over the years I've been involved with a lot of creative projects of all kinds. I don't know what I'd do without a workbench nearby, honestly. For as long as I can remember I've either been drawing something,  building or fixing something. Wait a minute! - the photo archives - a place for content! Now I have enough photos, text and memories to make a lot of work for myself trying to create code to handle it all! For the purposes of this website the three &quot;Cs&quot; would be Concept, Cohesiveness and Coding - now that I've got content taken care of...<br>

<h2>Various Works</h2>
<p>Earlier in STUDIES on the first page of this website I implemented what I might refer to as 'image delivery' - a way to click on an image that returns some enhanced way of viewing that image. On that page you click and a much bigger image zooms in and the background gets draped with a kind of dark theater mode where you can focus on the image. You click to get out and you enter and exit images  <em>one by one</em>. On this page I've used a similar javaScripted gallery however you can stay in there and go from image to image in the 'dark theater'. Additionally, there's a play button that initiates an automatic slideshow of the entirety of the images (some of which were taken before the advent of digital photography!). </p>
<p>Here's a little collection of works and projects I've done mostly in New York City but some in Western Ma. as well.</p>

  <h3>Carpentry </h3>
  <h4>Various</h4>
  <p>I put myself through college in New York City. Colleges don't give a wink what your work hours are - the courses are available when they are. Therefore I did a lot of freelance work during college working for most of NYC's art galleries, many businesses and people's homes day and night. Here is a small sampling of some works.</p>

  <h3>Guitar Work</h3>
  <h4>Repair - Make</h4>
  <p>I started working on other peoples guitars in the '80s.. The early 80's.. Okay, okay, it was way back in 1980. Mods, maintenance and making! I've made and fixed a variety of very cool instruments and worked with some very interesting, celebrity clientele along the way.</p><h3><i class="fa fa-volume-up"></i></h3>
